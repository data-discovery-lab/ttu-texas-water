                <title>Texas worst for unauthorized industrial water pollution</title>
                <description>AUSTIN – 132 industrial facilities dumped excessive pollution into Texas waterways 938 times
                    over 21 months, more than any other state in the nation, according to a new report by
                    Environment Texas Research and Policy Center.  The facilities rarely faced penalties for this pollution

                <title>New Water Policies Can Cut Pollution and Flooding</title>
                <description>AUSTIN — Local environmental groups today announced their support for changes to Austin’s land
                    development code that will help reduce water pollution and flooding severity. The proposals will require
                    future developments to retain a minimum amount of rainwater with on-site features, and to limit the amount of runoff
                    flowing into the city’s drainage system. AUSTIN Tuesday, October 31, 2017

                <title>Wheat crop stunted in Cape Girardeau, Missouri</title>
                <description>Dry conditions slowed crop planting and crop emergence in Cape Girardeau County, according to a
                    University of Missouri agronomy specialist. The wheat crop is shorter than that of one year ago, but is
                    uniform. The crops were described as brown, stunted, and stressed, but the crops were still alive.
