                <title>Wheat crop stunted in Cape Girardeau, Missouri</title>
                <description>Dry conditions slowed crop planting and crop emergence in Cape Girardeau County, according to a
                    University of Missouri agronomy specialist. The wheat crop is shorter than that of one year ago, but is
                    uniform. The crops were described as brown, stunted, and stressed, but the crops were still alive.

                <title>Industrial water use</title>
                <description>
                  The industries that produce metals, wood and paper products, chemicals, gasoline and oils, and those
                    invaluable grabber utensils you use to get your ring out of the garbage disposal are major users of water.
                    Probably every manufactured product uses water during some part of the production process.
                    Industrial water use includes water used for such purposes as fabricating, processing, washing, diluting,
                    cooling, or transporting a product; incorporating water into a product; or for sanitation needs within
                    the manufacturing facility. Some industries that use large amounts of water produce such
                    commodities as food, paper, chemicals, refined petroleum, or primary metals.

                <description>
                    The water in the Nation's rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and underground aquifers are vitally important
                    to our everyday life. These water bodies supply the water to serve the needs of every human and
                    for the world's ecological systems, too. Here in the United States, every 5 years the U.S.
                    Geological Survey (USGS) compiles county, state, and National water withdrawal and use data for
                    a number of water-use categories.

                <title>Domestic water use</title>
                <description>
                    Of course some of the most important uses for water are at our homes. Domestic water use is water
                    used for indoor and outdoor household purposesâ€” all the things you do at home: drinking, preparing
                    food, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, brushing your teeth, watering the yard and garden,
                    and even washing the dog.

                <title>How We Use Water</title>
                <description>The Earth might seem like it has abundant water, but in fact less than 1 percent is available
                    for human use. The rest is either salt water found in oceans, fresh water frozen in the polar ice caps,
                    or too inaccessible for practical usage. While population and demand on freshwater resources are increasing,
                    supply will always remain constant. And although it's true that the water cycle continuously returns
                    water to Earth, it is not always returned to the same place, or in the same quantity and quality.
