                <title>Wheat crop stunted in Cape Girardeau, Missouri</title>
                <description>Dry conditions slowed crop planting and crop emergence in Cape Girardeau County, according to a
                    University of Missouri agronomy specialist. The wheat crop is shorter than that of one year ago, but is
                    uniform. The crops were described as brown, stunted, and stressed, but the crops were still alive.
